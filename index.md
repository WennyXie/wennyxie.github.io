## About Me

I am a 1st Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, where I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://shangtongzhang.github.io/" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Prof. Shangtong Zhang</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/Sequential-Intelligence-Lab" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Sequential Intelligence Lab (SIL)</a>. My current research focuses on analyzing the convergence rates of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms under different noise conditions.

Prior to joining UVA, I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Fudan University, where I had the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DrcEuSkAAAAJ" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang</a>. During my academic journey, I also had the valuable opportunity to participate in the Learning, Optimization, and Games reading group led by <a href="https://xiaoqitan.org/" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Prof. Xiaoqi Tan</a> as an exchange student at the University of Alberta in 2023.
