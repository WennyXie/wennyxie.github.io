## About Me

I am a 1st Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, where I am fortunate to work with Prof. Shangtong Zhang in the Sequential Intelligence Lab (SIL). My current research focuses on analyzing the convergence rates of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms under different noise conditions.

Prior to joining UVA, I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Fudan University, where I had the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang. During my academic journey, I also had the valuable opportunity to participate in the SODA reading group led by Prof. Xiaoqi Tan as an exchange student at the University of Alberta in 2023.
